## Scripts for waydroid

Note this is a WIP so there is a lot of bug and/or errors
I don´t gotta time to fix it like a want, but it a least the scripts "work"

##### Packages needed:

```sh
sudo pacman -S qemu unzip git
```
###### Maybe more, please tell me

## Use only these scripts below, the others aren't read or its for debuging

##### install_LOS_18.sh
Will install Android 11 image on your waydroid

##### install_PlayStore_Waydroid_11.sh
Install Playstore, remove microg, and forge fingerprint to be able to use Play Services

##### install_magisk.sh
Will install magisk, i need to test and fix a little, for now what seens to be working is the root (maybe modules i don´t know, at least it dosent crash anymore when try to enable zygist)

##### start_waydroid_mutter.sh
Good helper to start waydroid from xfce


##### backup_img.sh
- ###### DO THIS FIRST, if you use brtfs will be quick
